<br>
**Project Overview:**<br>
  Handwriting sometimes can be hard to read, especially math symbols. Here is a solution To make converting math notes into pdf version more painless, we proposed supervised machine learning, a hybrid of KNN and SVM model, to develop an application that can accurately and efficiently convert handwritten data analytics class notes into text.

<br><br>
**Model Design:**<br>
    KNN-SVM hybrid model. <br>
    
    As the input data will be in .jpg format, which is non-binary. Our solution within machine learning scope is to transform the data into higher dimensional spaces to find hyperplanes, and then classify the data with KNN.
    <br><br>
**Motivation:**<br>
    Find a modern solution that makes math notes more portable and fetchable by effectively converting math notes to text and pdf version pain free.
