# Project Overview
  <br>
  Handwriting sometimes can be hard to read, especially math symbols. Here is a solution To make converting math notes into pdf version more painless, we proposed supervised machine learning, a hybrid of KNN and SVM model, to develop an application that can accurately and efficiently convert handwritten data analytics class notes into text.

# Motivation
  <br>
  Find a modern solution that makes math notes conversion pain free, 

# Model Design
  <br>
  Model design is referred to current hand writing recognition models; KNN will classify the data after the non-binary data being projected to higher dimensional spaces.
