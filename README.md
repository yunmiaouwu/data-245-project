# data-245-project
Overview and code demostration for term project on handwriting recognition system with a hybrid SVM-KNN method;

Project Overview：
  Handwriting sometimes can be hard to read, especially math symbols. Here is a solution To make converting math notes into pdf version more painless, we proposed supervised machine learning, a hybrid of KNN and SVM model, to develop an application that can accurately and efficiently convert handwritten data analytics class notes into text.


Model Design:
    KNN-SVM hybrid model.
